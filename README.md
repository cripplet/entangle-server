Concurrent File Editor Server

Note
----

This is on hold for the time being as I do some literature reading.

Overview
----

This is the server-side package for the `entangle` application. The goal here is to provide a socket API so that the *client* can be **language-agnostic**, as long as 
the communications protocol is followed.

Installation
----

```bash
clone 
sudo apt-get install libevent-dev
```
